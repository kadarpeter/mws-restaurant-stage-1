#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project description

The **Restaurant Reviews** projects, is (will be) a mobile-ready,  web application. It is responsive 
on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It uses a service worker for 
seamless offline experience for the users. 

### How to run?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up 
the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in 
use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, 
navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to 
see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and make start making a plan to implement the required features in 
three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

Or, you can use gulp with BrowserSync. Simply run `npm install`, then `gulp browsersync`. If you 
make eny changes to the HTML/CSS/JS files, the browser will automatically reload.
